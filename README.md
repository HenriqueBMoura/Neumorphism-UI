## About
Neumorphism-UI is a modern login interface designed using the neumorphism (or soft UI) design trend. This style creates an elegant, tactile feel with subtle shadows and highlights that make UI elements appear to extrude from the background.

## Features
- Clean, minimalist login form with neumorphic styling
- Soft shadows creating a subtle 3D effect
- Responsive design that works across devices
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Easy-to-customize color scheme

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom neumorphism properties)
- JavaScript (for interactive elements)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Explore the neumorphic login interface

## Customization
You can easily adapt the color scheme by modifying the CSS variables in the `:root` selector of the stylesheet:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #e0e5ec;
  --shadow-dark: #a3b1c6;
  --shadow-light: #ffffff;
}
```
